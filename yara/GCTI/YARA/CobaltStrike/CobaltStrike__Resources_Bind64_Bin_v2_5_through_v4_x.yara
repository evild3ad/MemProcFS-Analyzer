  // found in bind64 to differentate between this and reverse64
  // Note that we can reasonably assume that the constants being passed to the call rbp will be just that, constant,
  // since we are triggering on the API hasher. If that hasher is unchanged, then the hashes we look for should be
  // unchanged. This means we can use these values as anchors in our signature.
