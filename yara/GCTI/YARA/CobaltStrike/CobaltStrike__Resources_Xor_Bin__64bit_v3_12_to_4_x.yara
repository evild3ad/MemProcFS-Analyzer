	     in the cobaltstrike.jar files. For each stub found, sort them by byte count (size). Then for all entries in the 
	     same size category, compare them nibble by nibble. Any mismatched nibbles get 0'd. After all stubs have been
	     compared to each other thereby creating a mask, any 0 nibbles are turned to ? wildcards. The results are seen below */
